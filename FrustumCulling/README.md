FrustumCulling
==============

![Preview](https://raw.github.com/paulhoux/Cinder-Samples/master/FrustumCulling/PREVIEW.png)

This sample will show you how to:
* load an OBJ file and convert it to a fast-loading binary mesh file
* render 1500 meshes of 1000 polygons each for a total of 1,500,000 polygons
* use frustum culling to render this complex scene efficiently


For more information, see: http://forum.libcinder.org/topic/easier-frustum-culling


<u>Controls:</u>
* use the <b>mouse</b> to control the camera
* press <b>SPACE</b> to freeze the culling camera
* press <b>V</b> to toggle vertical sync
* press <b>F</b> to toggle full screen
* press <b>W</b> to toggle wire frames
* press <b>B</b> to toggle estimated bounding boxes
* press <b>Shift+B</b> to toggle exact bounding boxes
