This text is rendered very efficiently using a special Signed Distance Field font file (SDFF) and can be scaled to any size without much loss in rendering quality.

Use the mouse to drag (left button) or scale (right button) the text.
Use the mouse wheel to scroll the text.
Press PAGE_UP or PAGE_DOWN to scroll the text.
Press ENTER to reset scale to 100%.
Press [ or ] to change font size.
Press LEFT or RIGHT to change alignment.
Press UP or DOWN to change line spacing.
Press SPACE to swap colors.
Press F to toggle full screen.
Press V to toggle vertical sync.
Press W to toggle wire frames.
Press D to load a very long text ("Dracula" by Bram Stoker).
Press ESC to quit.

Tip: drag a single TXT file or another SDFF font file onto the TextRendering window to load and display it.

To create a new cross-platform SDFF font file:
1) Drag a font file (.TTF, .OTF) onto the SDFont.exe application, which you can find in "./assets/fonts"
2) The SDFont.exe will generate two files: a TXT and a PNG.
3) Run this sample and drag the PNG and TXT files onto the window.
4) Enjoy your new SDFF font file!
